  * Prompt:
    
    A dynamic and intense illustration of a person running against time. The scene should depict a person, gender-neutral, in a modern urban setting, with clocks and watches surrounding them, symbolizing the urgency. The background features a cityscape at dusk, with shadows growing long, emphasizing the race against time. The person is portrayed in a mid-stride, muscles tensed, with a look of determination and urgency on their face. The clocks and watches around them are distorted, melting or spinning, to represent the pressure and the fluidity of time. The colors used are predominantly warm tones, with hints of red, orange, and deep shadows to enhance the mood of urgency and tension.

  * Prompt:
    
    A cartoon-style illustration of a person with an expression of doubt, questioning whether something is a myth. The character should be a gender-neutral figure, with exaggerated features typical of cartoons, like large eyes and expressive eyebrows. The person is shown scratching their head or holding their chin thoughtfully, with a speech bubble containing a question mark or the word 'Myth?'. The background is simple, perhaps with soft colors or abstract shapes, to keep the focus on the character's expression and body language.
